# Hey guys! I'm Tanmay

I am a final-year software engineering student at the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) at the University of Technology, Sydney. 

As a software engineer, I offer a diverse skill set, with proficiency and experience in languages such C#, Java, Python and SQL, web-frameworks like ASP.NET, Angular and React, and am continually working on expanding it by taking on challenging projects, be it through competitions, personal challenges and goals.

As a means of empowering others with the skill set I am continuously building, I write articles on LinkedIn relating to software development and personal development. I invite you to read, share and give me honest feedback on them so that I can serve my readers better.
